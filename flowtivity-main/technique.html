        <h2>pomodoro</h2>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - Wikipedia</p>

        <h2>Pareto Principles (80/20 rule)</h2>

The 80/20 rule is intended to bring purpose and worth to your day by pushing you to prioritize what is important.
