    <p>Our main goal through flowtivity is to promote efficient and productive habits to our users and those who generally struggle to be productive or are easily distracted.</p>
    <p>For example, some students never learned how to study properly, therefore higher education may be more of a challenge, and we're here to help them with that challenge.</p>
    <p>We also strive to help those with conditions that may affect their ability to focus, so through our website, we hope to help others achieve their goals more proactively.</p>
